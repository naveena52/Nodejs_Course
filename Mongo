Roll No  | Hindi | English |  Computer
  1      |  86   |         |
  2      |       |    78   | 
  3      |  69   |         |   78
In the above unstructured data scenario there is a wasteage of space can be seen in the case of MYSQL

Mongo DB Introduction :
NoSql
> Not a sql
> JSON
> bz of json it is good for Both structred and unstructred
> Nested Data 

A/c Terminology wise the saving of data will be :
[
    {
        "rollNo":1,
        "Hindi":86
    },
    {
        "rollNo":2,
        "English":78
    },
    {
        "rollNo":2,
        "Hindi":69,
        "Computer":78
If in future when we need to add one more subject then we simply add by adding one row under that student 
there is no space wasteage 
    }
